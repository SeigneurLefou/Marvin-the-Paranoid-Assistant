# Marvin the Paranoid Assistant

Marvina is a personal assistant designed to automate tasks or create macros in Python, and soon in Bash, C, and C++. Macros are functions in a supported language that Marvin includes in his code as a subcommand. You can also use basic commands like `marvin albbl "text"` in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` by defining simple functions. Macros are just one part of Marvin's capabilities—over time, you could even code a game and integrate it into Marvin using `sys` and importing different files.
